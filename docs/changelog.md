# Changelog

## v1.5.0

- **Unity 2022 Android build fix** -- AGP 7.4.2's D8 dexer crashes on Java 11 class files in the EOS AAR (NullPointerException on NestHost/NestMembers attributes and `$values()` enum pattern). The build processor now auto-applies a 3-part workaround: empties the AAR's classes.jar, includes pre-dexed classes (built with Unity 6's D8), and adds a compile-only JAR for javac resolution. Fully automatic, no user action needed.
- **Multi-version Android support** -- build processor adapts Gradle config per Unity version (Java 8/11/17, desugar_jdk_libs 1.2.3/2.0.4/2.1.4, D8 workaround on/off). Tested and working on Unity 2022.3, 6000.0, 6000.1, and 6000.3.
- **Minimum Unity version lowered** -- now supports Unity 2021.3+ (previously required Unity 6000.0+)
- **VoIP init timing instrumentation** -- every voice init step now logs with `[TIMING]` tag showing elapsed milliseconds (`GetRTCRoomName`, `RegisterAudioNotifications`, `QueryAudioDevices`, auto-unmute callback)
- **Pre-query audio devices at login** -- `PreQueryAudioDevices()` runs automatically on `EOSManager.OnLoginSuccess`, warming up the device cache so voice connects faster when joining a lobby
- **`OnVoiceInitProgress` event** -- fires step-by-step messages during voice init (`"Getting room name..."`, `"Querying audio devices..."`, `"Voice ready!"`) for UI progress indicators
- **Skip redundant device query** -- if devices were already pre-queried at login, the voice connect path skips `QueryAudioDevices()` entirely

## v1.4.6

- **Gradle Template Generator** -- one-click fix for `FakeDependency.jar` errors on Android. Open `Tools > EOS SDK > Android Build Validator` and click "Generate EOS Gradle Templates".
- **Build Processor Robustness** -- `compileOptions` fallback injection, post-injection verification to confirm Gradle changes were applied correctly.
- **Pre-Build Validator** -- automatic warnings about Android configuration issues before build starts (`IPreprocessBuildWithReport`). Warns but does not block.
- **Version Checker** -- `Tools > EOS SDK > Check for Updates` to check for new releases.
- **Fix** -- `EOSConfig.EncryptionKey` no longer defaults to null (defaults to empty string to prevent NullReferenceException).
- **Fix** -- `EOSPlayerRegistry.RegisterPlayer` no longer crashes on short PUIDs (less than 32 characters).

## v1.4.5

- **Android Build Validator** -- new editor window (`Tools > EOS SDK > Android Build Validator`) with 10 checks and auto-fix buttons for common Android build issues.
- **Enhanced Build Processor Logging** -- detailed logs showing exactly what the `EOSAndroidBuildProcessor` injects into each Gradle file.

## v1.4.4

- **Fix** -- `EOSVoicePlayer` not receiving audio when `EOSVoiceManager` initializes late (race condition where audio frame callback was registered before the voice manager was ready).
